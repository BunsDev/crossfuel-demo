### Tenderly

Communicating the inner workings of Account Abstraction to users is challenging. To enhance the user experience, we're using Tenderly to simulate transaction results. This allows users to review the transaction outcome before submitting it to the bundler, thereby ensuring the security of the process. This security feature is critical in making the Account Abstraction wallet widely accepted.

### Bounty

We've chosen option 1, which allows users to discard unwanted transactions in the dapp UI. Our UI, developed with Metamask snap, displays relevant information about transaction execution, including event logs. Users can either approve sending the transaction to the chain or discard it.
